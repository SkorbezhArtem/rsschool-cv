# Something about me

Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. 
As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.

# Code example
```
let animal = {
    name: "animal",
    age: 10,
    childs: ["child 1", "child 2"]
};
 
let cat = clone(animal);
    cat.name = "cat";
    cat.age = 5;
cat.childs.push("child 3");
 
console.log(cat.name, cat.age); // cat 5
console.log(cat.childs); // [ 'child 1', 'child 2', 'child 3' ]
console.log(animal.name, animal.age); // cat 5
console.log(animal.childs); // [ 'child 1', 'child 2', 'child 3' ]

function clone(obj) {
    return obj;
}
```
